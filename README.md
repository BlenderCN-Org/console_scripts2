## Brief
This addon is a spin-off [console_writer](https://github.com/Walid-Shouman/console_writer).

## Motivation
This module has a different way of splitting the ```__init__.py``` file into ```__init__.py```, ```__register__.py``` and ```__reload__.py```  .

It's considered an easier way, as it totally depend on splitting the code text, rather than splitting the implementation. Which makes it easier to understand due to similarity with unstructured addons.
